"""FastMCP stdio server wiring: build the server, register tools, run over stdio.

This adapter is the only place the MCP SDK is imported. It resolves the database
path, opens the SQLite store, constructs the repository/audit/clock and the app
use cases, and injects them into the tool layer. All logging goes to STDERR — the
stdio transport uses STDOUT for the protocol itself, so anything printed there
would corrupt the stream.
