# /people-context:reminders

A thin, user-invoked workflow that lists reminders. When the user names a person it
resolves that identity first, then filters; otherwise it lists everything active.

Optional person filter: **$ARGUMENTS**

## Steps

1. **No person given** (the argument above is empty): call `list_reminders` with no
   `person_id`. It returns active reminders, due-dated first and communication notes
   last.

2. **A person is named:** resolve the identity before filtering. Call `resolve_person`
   with the given text and branch on its own `ambiguous` flag — not on candidate count.
   The resolver may return several ranked candidates yet report `ambiguous: false`
   when the top match is confidently ahead.

   - **`ambiguous: false` with at least one candidate:** call `list_reminders` with
     the ranked top candidate's (`candidates[0]`) `person_id`.
   - **`ambiguous: true`:** stop and surface the candidate list so the user can
     choose. Do **not** silently drop the person filter and list everyone's
     reminders, and do not guess a candidate.
   - **Empty candidate list:** report that no one matching is stored rather than
     falling back to an unfiltered list; let the user restate who they mean.

## Boundaries

- Read-only workflow: it calls only `resolve_person` and `list_reminders`. It
  performs no writes.
- It never calls or suggests enabling the gated `get_sensitive_person_context` or
  `export_data` tools.
- Ambiguity is always surfaced; the person filter is never silently discarded.
