# MCP Registry and community-directory metadata

This document records how `people-context` presents itself to the official MCP Registry and to the community
directories, which files in this repository carry that metadata, and which steps remain manual account-owner
actions. It delivers checklist item **M8.2** of [docs/specs/pr-plan.md](specs/pr-plan.md); see
[docs/specs/m8-distribution-and-reach.md](specs/m8-distribution-and-reach.md) for the binding milestone
specification.

The canonical tool inventory and response contracts live in [docs/mcp-interface.md](mcp-interface.md). Directory
listings reuse those descriptions; this document does not restate them.

## Namespace decision

The durable public identity is the reverse-DNS namespace:

```
io.github.jinyangwang27/people-context
```

This is a deliberate, recorded choice because the Registry namespace becomes permanent public identity. The
`io.github.*` namespace is the GitHub-hosted-project namespace; ownership of `io.github.jinyangwang27/*` is proven
by GitHub authentication of the `JinyangWang27` account at publication time and by the ownership marker committed to
the packaged README:

```
<!-- mcp-name: io.github.jinyangwang27/people-context -->
```

The marker is in the repository-root [README.md](../README.md), which is the file packaged as the PyPI project's
long description, so the ownership proof ships inside the published distribution.

## Registry metadata file

[`server.json`](../server.json) at the repository root follows the pinned official Registry schema
(`https://static.modelcontextprotocol.io/schemas/2025-12-11/server.schema.json`). It declares:

- the server `name` `io.github.jinyangwang27/people-context` and a top-level `version` that tracks the application
  release (`project.version` in [pyproject.toml](../pyproject.toml));
- a single PyPI `packages` entry;
- a `stdio` package transport (not an arbitrary command/args description).

### Alternate-entry-point representation

A client assembles the run command as `<runtimeHint> <runtimeArguments> <identifier> <packageArguments>` — the
package `identifier` is inserted as the executed command between the runtime arguments and the package arguments.
The MCP server console script (`people-context-mcp`) differs from the primary distribution name (`people-context`),
whose own `people-context` console script is the human CLI, not the server. So the entry uses:

- `identifier`: `people-context-mcp` — the console-script command `uvx` executes;
- `runtimeHint`: `uvx`;
- `runtimeArguments`: `--from people-context==<server version>` — installs the active primary distribution pinned
  to the server version, whose `people-context-mcp` script is the server.

This reconstructs the documented invocation, pinned for reproducibility:

```
uvx --from people-context==0.1.1 people-context-mcp
```

The command identifier must not also be repeated in `packageArguments`; doing so would assemble
`uvx --from people-context people-context people-context-mcp`, which runs the `people-context` CLI with a stray
argument instead of the server.

**Reproducible version selection.** A Registry entry is a versioned snapshot, so the primary requirement is pinned
with `==<server version>` rather than left to resolve to the latest release. This keeps a client that selects the
historical `0.1.1` Registry entry on `people-context` `0.1.1` code and contracts, honouring the same-version
package contract in [docs/specs/m8-distribution-and-reach.md](specs/m8-distribution-and-reach.md) and the
synchronization assumptions in [docs/specs/m12-trust-stability-v1.md](specs/m12-trust-stability-v1.md). Because the
console-script name differs from the distribution name, the same-version guarantee is expressed through this pinned
`--from` primary (whose installed version equals the server version) rather than through a `version` on the command
`identifier` — pinning `people-context-mcp==<server version>` would not resolve, since the compatibility
distribution carries an independent version line. The pinned `--from` value, the reconstructed command, the single
stdio PyPI entry, and the ownership markers are asserted — and kept in lockstep with the server version — both in CI
(`.github/workflows/mcp-registry-validate.yml`) and in `tests/test_registry_metadata.py`. **Every server version
bump must update this `==` pin together with the top-level `version`.**

Because the Registry links a PyPI package to the server through a `mcp-name:` marker in that package's published
README, the marker is committed to both the repository-root [README.md](../README.md) (the `people-context`
long description) and the identifier package's
[compat/people-context-mcp/README.md](../compat/people-context-mcp/README.md).

## Pinned validator

Validation uses the Registry's own `mcp-publisher` CLI, pinned to an exact reviewed release (`v1.8.0`). Because
release tags are mutable, the `.github/workflows/mcp-registry-validate.yml` workflow verifies the downloaded archive
against a repository-pinned immutable content digest (`MCP_PUBLISHER_SHA256`) — not the release's own checksums
file, which an asset swap could rewrite in lockstep — before executing the binary and running
`mcp-publisher validate server.json`. No floating `latest` CLI is installed. Bumping the validator is a reviewed
change to both `MCP_PUBLISHER_VERSION` and `MCP_PUBLISHER_SHA256` in that workflow.

## Publication (manual, account-owner step)

Actual Registry publication is a manual release step that requires interactive GitHub authentication and therefore
is **out of scope for automation in this PR** (M8.2 excludes live publication/approval).

**Prerequisite — publish a marker-bearing `people-context-mcp` artifact first.** The Registry validates the package
named by `identifier` (`people-context-mcp`) by fetching its published PyPI README and confirming the `mcp-name:`
marker. `docs/releasing.md` uploads artifacts only when the GitHub Release workflow runs, and the currently
published `people-context-mcp` `0.1.0.post1` artifact predates this ownership marker. Crucially, bumping only the
root `project.version` does **not** republish the compatibility package: its version in
[compat/people-context-mcp/pyproject.toml](../compat/people-context-mcp/pyproject.toml) is a fixed line, and
`release.yml` uploads it with `skip-existing: true`, so an unchanged version is skipped and the old marker-less
README stays on PyPI. `mcp-publisher publish` would then still fail package validation. Successful PyPI publication
of a marker-bearing `people-context-mcp` release must therefore precede publication:

1. Bump `project.version`; **also bump the `version` in `compat/people-context-mcp/pyproject.toml`** so
   `skip-existing` uploads a fresh compatibility artifact; and **update `server.json` in the same commit** — set the
   top-level `version` and the `--from people-context==<version>` pin to the new release. (The synchronization
   assertions in `tests/test_registry_metadata.py` fail the build if `server.json` is left behind.) Keep the
   `mcp-name:` marker in both the `people-context` and `people-context-mcp` packaged READMEs. Merge.
2. Cut the GitHub Release so `release.yml` uploads the new marker-bearing artifacts — including the bumped
   `people-context-mcp` — to PyPI, and wait for that publication to complete.
3. Install the pinned publisher, verified against the same immutable digest the CI job uses, and invoke that binary
   explicitly (it is not otherwise on `PATH`):

   ```bash
   # Keep in sync with .github/workflows/mcp-registry-validate.yml.
   MCP_PUBLISHER_VERSION="v1.8.0"
   MCP_PUBLISHER_SHA256="1370446bbe74d562608e8005a6ccce02d146a661fbd78674e11cc70b9618d6cf"
   archive="mcp-publisher_linux_amd64.tar.gz"  # pick the asset for your platform
   curl -fLsS -o "$archive" \
     "https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry/releases/download/${MCP_PUBLISHER_VERSION}/${archive}"
   echo "${MCP_PUBLISHER_SHA256}  ${archive}" | sha256sum --check --strict -
   tar -xzf "$archive" mcp-publisher
   ```

4. Only then run the Registry publication with that pinned binary:

   ```bash
   ./mcp-publisher login github
   ./mcp-publisher validate server.json
   ./mcp-publisher publish
   ```

`mcp-publisher login github` performs the GitHub OAuth device flow that proves control of the
`io.github.jinyangwang27` namespace. `publish` is run by the account owner only after the marker-bearing PyPI
artifact is live.

## Community-directory submission matrix

Verified against each directory's primary submission documentation. Entries marked *manual* require an
account-owner action (form submission or authenticated claim) that cannot be completed from repository metadata
alone; entries marked *repository* are driven by files committed here.

| Directory | Primary documentation | Submission path | Required in-repo metadata | Package / transport representation | Ownership / auth step | Live publication |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **MCP Registry** | https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/registry (`docs/`) | Repository metadata + `mcp-publisher` | [`server.json`](../server.json) (schema `2025-12-11`) and the `mcp-name:` marker in both packaged READMEs | PyPI `stdio` entry; `uvx --from people-context==<server version> people-context-mcp` | GitHub OAuth via `mcp-publisher login github` proves `io.github.jinyangwang27` | Manual `mcp-publisher publish` after the marker-bearing PyPI artifact is live |
| **Smithery** | https://smithery.ai/docs | Manual (authenticated GitHub claim; Smithery indexes the repo/README) | None required for a local `stdio` server; the canonical invocation and description come from README/`server.json` | Documented as local `uvx` stdio; Smithery's hosted-deployment model does not apply to this local-first server | Claim the server in the Smithery dashboard using the `JinyangWang27` GitHub account | Manual claim/listing by the account owner |
| **PulseMCP** | https://www.pulsemcp.com/submit | Manual (submission form / crawler) | None; PulseMCP ingests GitHub and Registry metadata | Reuses the Registry `server.json` package/transport once published | Submit the GitHub URL from the `JinyangWang27` account | Manual form submission by the account owner |
| **mcp.so** | https://mcp.so/submit | Manual (submission form; consumes Registry) | None; mcp.so consumes the published Registry entry and README | Reuses the Registry `server.json` package/transport once published | Submit the GitHub/Registry URL | Manual form submission by the account owner |
| **Glama** | https://glama.ai/mcp/servers | Repository metadata (auto-indexed) + optional claim | [`glama.json`](../glama.json) (schema `https://glama.ai/mcp/schemas/server.json`) declaring `maintainers` | Auto-indexed from the public GitHub repository and README | Claim the server in Glama using the `JinyangWang27` GitHub account | Auto-indexed; maintainer claim is manual |

### Notes

- No directory listing introduces analytics, telemetry, or a divergent tool inventory. Descriptions are reused
  from [docs/mcp-interface.md](mcp-interface.md) and the packaged project description.
- Where a directory publishes an official validator, it is pinned: the Registry `mcp-publisher` is pinned in CI.
  Smithery, PulseMCP, and mcp.so provide no repository-side validator for a local `stdio` server, so their rows are
  validated by documentation review and link checks rather than a pinned CLI. `glama.json` is a small static file
  validated as well-formed metadata in `tests/test_registry_metadata.py`.
- Live publication and per-directory approval remain manual account-owner steps and are intentionally not automated
  here.
