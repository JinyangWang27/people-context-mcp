# CLI

`people-context` is the human-operated companion to the MCP server. It uses the same application use cases for
curation, so validation, audit, HLC, and changelog capture match MCP writes.

## Global option

`--db PATH` explicitly selects the SQLite database and overrides every other location source.

## Commands

| Command | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `db-path [-v]` | Print the resolved DB path; verbose mode prints the complete resolution trace. |
| `list [--all] [--limit N]` | List people; `--all` includes soft-deleted rows. |
| `search QUERY [--limit N]` | Ranked lexical person search. |
| `show PERSON` | Resolve an id/name and print identity plus context; relationships use perspective `display_type`. |
| `export [--output FILE]` | Full portable JSON envelope, unchanged by M7. |
| `edit PERSON [--name NAME] [--summary TEXT]` | Edit canonical identity fields. |
| `add-alias PERSON VALUE [--kind KIND] [--lang LANG] [--script SCRIPT]` | Add an alias. |
| `set communication_philosophy VALUE` | Set the supported user preference. |
| `delete PERSON [--yes]` | Preview and permanently forget a person graph. |
| `sync-log [--limit N] [--entity ID] [--payloads]` | Inspect local replay entries; payloads are opt-in. |
| `reindex` | Rebuild the active-person FTS index. |
| `reindex --semantic` | Explicitly obtain the pinned model and atomically rebuild semantic vectors. |
| `relationship-types` | List vocabulary and uncategorized types currently used by active edges. |
| `relationship-types add ...` | Add portable custom vocabulary (add-only in v1). |
| `normalize-relationships [--apply]` | Dry-run or apply audited canonical rewrites of legacy edges. |
| `export-vault --output DIR [--include-sensitive]` | Generate a deterministic Obsidian relationship vault. |
| `service install [--port PORT]` | Install and start the loopback HTTP backend as a systemd user service (Linux). |
| `service status` | Show the systemd user service status. |
| `service uninstall` | Stop, disable, and remove the systemd user service. |

`show`, `edit`, `add-alias`, and `delete` try an active id first and then `ResolvePerson`. Unknown references exit
1; ambiguous names exit 2 and print candidates rather than guessing.

## Relationship vocabulary

List seeded/custom rows and uncategorized stored types:

```bash
uv run people-context relationship-types
```

Add a symmetric custom type with repeatable synonyms:

```bash
uv run people-context relationship-types add co_founder_of \
  --category professional --symmetric --synonym cofounder
```

Add an inverse pair:

```bash
uv run people-context relationship-types add advises \
  --category professional --inverse advised_by
```

`--inverse` and `--symmetric` are mutually exclusive. Type, inverse, category, and synonyms are normalized to
snake case. Existing rows/synonyms are rejected because v1 vocabulary is add-only. Custom vocabulary is written
through the M6 audit/changelog seam; migration seeds are reference data and are not logged.

## Normalize legacy relationships

Migration 003 does not rewrite stored edges. Preview changes:

```bash
uv run people-context normalize-relationships
```

Apply them:

```bash
uv run people-context normalize-relationships --apply
```

Dry-run is the default and performs no writes. Apply uses the same canonical policy as `set_relationship` and
captures every update/removal atomically in audit and changelog. Only duplicates with overlapping validity
periods are merged; an edge active today is preferred, otherwise the older row is retained.

## Vault export

```bash
uv run people-context export-vault --output ~/PeopleVault
```

The destination must be nonexistent, empty, or already contain `.people-context-vault`. A non-empty unmarked
directory is refused without changes. Re-export replaces only the marker plus `People/` and `Organizations/`;
`.obsidian/` and every other user-created path are preserved. Use `--include-sensitive` only with explicit intent;
exported Markdown is outside the server's disclosure controls. See [vault-export.md](vault-export.md).

## Database location resolution

The CLI and server use the same first-match order:

1. explicit `--db`/server argument;
2. `PEOPLE_CONTEXT_DB`;
3. `db_path` in `{XDG_CONFIG_HOME or ~/.config}/people-context/config.toml`;
4. `OPENCLAW_WORKSPACE`, then `~/.openclaw/workspace`, storing `people-context/people.db`;
5. `{XDG_DATA_HOME or ~/.local/share}/people-context/people.db`.

Paths are expanded and parent directories are created only when SQLite opens the selected database.

## Direct SQLite access

The file is plain SQLite and may be inspected with DB Browser, Datasette, or `sqlite3`. Prefer CLI/MCP writes:
direct SQL bypasses audit/changelog capture and can stale FTS/semantic derived indexes. Repair person FTS with
`reindex`; repair semantic vectors with `reindex --semantic`. Directly inserted legacy relationship types may be
made canonical and replayable with `normalize-relationships --apply`.

## Server transport flags

`people-context-mcp` is stdio by default. `--http --host 127.0.0.1 --port 8765` selects unauthenticated loopback
Streamable HTTP at `/mcp`; no other bind host is accepted.

`people-context service install` is an explicit Linux/systemd convenience command. It writes a user unit using the
current Python environment, pins the resolved database path, enables startup with the user service manager, and
starts the backend immediately. It never binds outside loopback. Package installation does not invoke it
implicitly. Use `service uninstall` to remove the unit.
