# Claude Code plugin

The repository is also a self-hosted Claude Code plugin marketplace. The plugin launches `people-context-mcp` locally over MCP stdio; no hosted application server, public endpoint, domain, OAuth service, or shared database is required.

## Requirements

- Claude Code 2.1.196 or newer
- [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) available on `PATH`
- Git access to this repository while it is private

## Install from GitHub

Add the marketplace:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add JinyangWang27/people-context-mcp
```

Install the plugin:

```bash
claude plugin install people-context@people-context-plugins
```

Restart Claude Code or run `/reload-plugins`. Use `/mcp` to confirm that the `people-context` server is connected.

Inside an interactive Claude Code session, the equivalent commands are:

```text
/plugin marketplace add JinyangWang27/people-context-mcp
/plugin install people-context@people-context-plugins
/reload-plugins
```

## Local runtime

When the plugin is enabled, Claude Code starts this command automatically:

```bash
uv run --project "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}" people-context-mcp \
  --db "${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}/people_context.db"
```

`CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT` points to Claude Code's installed copy of this repository. `CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA` is a persistent per-plugin directory, so the SQLite database survives marketplace updates and plugin reinstalls.

The MCP server uses stdio. It does not listen on a TCP port and is available only to the local Claude Code process that launched it.

## Security model

Installing this plugin executes the repository's Python code locally through `uv` with the permissions of your operating-system user. It is not a sandboxed, data-only extension. Install only revisions you trust.

The durable store is an unencrypted SQLite file under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`. Normal filesystem permissions and full-disk encryption are the at-rest security boundary. Anyone who can read that file can inspect its contents directly.

The default plugin configuration deliberately does not set either high-disclosure process capability:

- `get_person_context` returns only public and personal records; sensitive and restricted records are unavailable.
- `get_sensitive_person_context` is not registered unless the operator starts a different server process with `PEOPLE_CONTEXT_MCP_ENABLE_SENSITIVE=1`.
- `export_data` is not registered unless the operator starts a different server process with `PEOPLE_CONTEXT_MCP_ENABLE_EXPORT=1`. Use the human-operated `people-context export` CLI for routine portability.

MCP annotations are advisory client metadata, not authorization. The process-level capability gates above are what prevent prompt content from widening the disclosure boundary. Email and mbox Subject values are treated as attacker-controlled input and replaced with the neutral summary `Email correspondence` before staging or persistence.

See [Privacy and Safety](privacy-and-safety.md) for the complete threat model.

## Update and release

Refresh the marketplace and plugin after a new release is merged:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace update people-context-plugins
claude plugin update people-context@people-context-plugins
```

The plugin and marketplace entry use semantic versioning, starting at `0.1.0`. Bump both version fields whenever a release should become available to installed users. Ordinary commits that do not change the version are not treated as plugin updates.

## Local validation

From the repository root:

```bash
claude plugin validate . --strict
uv run people-context-mcp --help
uv run pytest -q tests/adapters/test_mcp_server.py tests/adapters/test_email_import.py
```

For an end-to-end local installation test:

```bash
claude plugin marketplace add ./ --scope local
claude plugin install people-context@people-context-plugins --scope local
```

Then restart Claude Code or run `/reload-plugins`, inspect `/mcp`, and exercise `resolve_person`, `get_person_context`, and `remember_person` against a temporary database. Confirm that `get_sensitive_person_context` and `export_data` are absent from ordinary tool discovery.

## Public Anthropic distribution

The self-hosted GitHub marketplace works without Anthropic review. Once it has been tested publicly, the same repository can be submitted for the Anthropic community plugin directory through the Claude Console plugin submission form.

Anthropic's `claude-plugins-official` marketplace is curated separately and currently has no public application process. A community-directory submission does not automatically add the plugin to the official marketplace.

Before submitting:

1. Make the repository publicly accessible.
2. Run `claude plugin validate . --strict` on the intended release commit.
3. Confirm installation from a clean machine using the GitHub marketplace commands above.
4. Verify that all durable data remains under `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_DATA}`.
5. Confirm that the default tool surface excludes high-disclosure reads.
6. Document the local execution model, required `uv` dependency, tool behavior, and privacy properties.
