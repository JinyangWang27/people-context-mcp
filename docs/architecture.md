# Architecture

`people-context` is built as a hexagonal (ports & adapters) system. A small `domain` + `app` core holds
all product logic and imports nothing from the outside world; every technology-specific concern — SQLite,
the MCP SDK, file-based importers, the CLI — lives in an adapter that depends on the core through narrow
interfaces (`ports`). This document explains the layers, the dependency rule, how new adapters slot in, and
several structural decisions that only make sense in the context of this layout.

See also: [docs/data-model.md](data-model.md) for what the core actually stores, and
[docs/decisions/0003-hexagonal-architecture.md](decisions/0003-hexagonal-architecture.md) for the ADR.

## Layer responsibilities

### `domain`

Pure data and small, dependency-free behaviour: `Person`, `Alias`, `Relationship`, `Organization`,
`Affiliation`, `Fact`, `Observation`, `Trait`, `Interaction`, `Reminder`, and the shared value objects
(`Confidence`, `Sensitivity`, `Provenance`, `ValidityPeriod`, ULID id generation, name normalization). These
are Pydantic models with no knowledge of persistence, transport, or process boundaries. Modules group only
cohesive domain concepts.

### `app`

Use cases are organized by product capability: `people`, `context`, `records`, `relationships`, `imports`,
`exports`, and `semantic`. Small symmetric use cases may share a focused module; workflows with distinct
models, staging, and orchestration responsibilities are split. Classes still remain focused and depend only
on `domain` and narrow `ports`, never on a concrete adapter. The root `app` package is not a public barrel.
Use cases contain the only place application-level policy (e.g. the ambiguity threshold in identity
resolution, or the minimal-disclosure cap in context assembly) is allowed to live.

### `ports`

`typing.Protocol` interfaces, split narrowly by concern rather than one fat repository interface:
`PersonReader` and `PersonWriter` (`ports/repository.py`), semantic embedding/vector/rebuild ports
(`ports/semantic.py`), `AuditLog` (`ports/audit_log.py`), `Changelog` (`ports/changelog.py`),
`MergeStore` (`ports/merge.py`), `ForgetStore` and `ForgetPreviewStore` (`ports/forget.py`),
`HybridLogicalClock` (`ports/hlc.py`), `UnitOfWork` (`ports/unit_of_work.py`), and `Clock` (`ports/clock.py`).
Splitting concerns means read, merge, forget, audit, and sync use cases depend only on capabilities they consume.
The application layer owns transaction orchestration through the UoW port; SQLite owns BEGIN/COMMIT/ROLLBACK.

### `adapters`

Concrete implementations of the ports, plus anything that talks to the outside world:

- `adapters/sqlite/` — `db.py` (connection, migrations, and local device initialization), migrations
  `001_initial.sql` and `002_sync_foundations.sql`, repositories, focused merge/forget, organization, preference,
  record, audit, changelog, HLC, and unit-of-work adapters. `record_store.py` persists only assertive records and
  reminders. Adapter write methods join an enclosing transaction rather than committing independently.
- `adapters/mcp/` — `server.py` (`build_server`/`main`, tool registration and annotations), `tools/` (one
  module per tool group).
- `adapters/importers/` — source-specific, stdlib-backed email, ICS, LinkedIn, and vCard extraction plus
  routing; every importer feeds the shared candidate staging use case described in [docs/import.md](import.md).
- `adapters/model2vec_embeddings.py`, `adapters/semantic_indexing.py`, and `adapters/sqlite/semantic.py` —
  optional cached embeddings, best-effort lifecycle refresh decorators, and same-file cosine vec0 storage.
- `cli/` — parser/dispatch and capability command modules for the `people-context` CLI, built on the same
  application runtime as the MCP tools while preserving `people_context.cli:main`.
- `adapters/runtime.py` — the shared composition root for SQLite, optional semantic decorators, clocks, and
  application use cases. Process entrypoints inject their own warning sink.
- `config.py` — DB path resolution (flag → env → config file → agent workspace → XDG); this is itself an
  adapter concern (it reads environment and filesystem) but is small enough to live at the package root.

## Dependency rule

Dependencies point inward only:

```
adapters/process  →  app  →  ports
                     │       │
                     └───────┴──→ domain
```

`domain` has no outward project-layer dependencies, `ports` depends only on `domain`, and `app` depends only
on `domain` and `ports` (plus modules within its own capability packages). A standard-library AST test
enforces these rules and rejects internal runtime import cycles. Any concrete adapter, MCP, SQLite, CLI, or
other process dependency entering the core is a layering bug.

## How new transports and importers slot in

Because `app` only depends on `ports`, adding a new way to reach the core is purely additive:

- **Streamable HTTP (delivered, M4).** `build_server()` remains the sole construction and registration path.
  `main()` alone selects the default stdio transport or configures loopback Streamable HTTP, so transport
  choice never duplicates use-case or tool wiring.
- **New importers (delivered pattern).** Email/mbox and vCard adapters parse source formats into the same
  strict person/interaction/affiliation/fact candidate shapes. `stage_candidates` exposes that same path to
  agents extracting concise facts from notes; format parsing differs, while validation, matching, local-ref
  rewriting, atomic staging, review, and commit remain shared.
- **New repository backends.** Anything implementing `PersonReader`/`PersonWriter` (an in-memory fake for
  tests, a different embedded database) is a drop-in substitute for `SqlitePeopleRepository` — this is the
  Liskov Substitution Principle applied to the repository port, and it is what makes `app`-level tests
  possible without touching SQLite at all.

## Entrypoint wiring

Wiring — constructing concrete adapters and injecting them into use cases — happens only at entrypoints,
never inside `domain` or `app`:

- `adapters/runtime.py:build_runtime()` resolves the DB path, opens the SQLite connection, constructs the
  concrete stores and `SystemClock`, applies optional semantic decorators, and builds the application use
  cases once. CLI and MCP inject different warning callbacks without duplicating setup.
- `adapters/mcp/server.py:build_server()` obtains the shared runtime and registers MCP tools that call its use
  cases. `main()` parses `--db` plus transport flags; it runs
  stdio by default or applies loopback HTTP settings before `run(transport="streamable-http")`.

  The server shares one SQLite connection (`check_same_thread=True`) across all tools, which is safe because
  the pinned MCP SDK invokes synchronous tools inline on the event-loop thread. Two consequences are accepted
  for now: a long tool call blocks the whole server, and upgrading to an SDK that dispatches sync tools to
  worker threads would require moving to a connection-per-request (or serialized-access) design first. Revisit
  this deliberately when bumping the `mcp` dependency — do not just flip `check_same_thread`.
- `cli/main.py:main()` performs parser dispatch against the same runtime, so CLI commands and MCP tools call
  the exact same use case classes and therefore obey the exact same audit/provenance rules.
- `__main__.py` (`python -m people_context`) is a thin alias to the stdio server entrypoint.

This is Dependency Inversion in practice: `app` and `domain` depend only on abstractions (`ports`); concrete
choices are made once, at the edge, in the entrypoint that happens to be running.

## SOLID mapping

| Principle | How it is applied here |
|---|---|
| **S**ingle Responsibility | Cohesive capability modules contain focused classes; file count is not a proxy for responsibility. |
| **O**pen/Closed | New adapters add tools, importers, and transports without changing core policy. |
| **L**iskov Substitution | SQLite and in-memory implementations substitute behind the same ports. |
| **I**nterface Segregation | Reader, writer, audit, and clock ports stay narrow. |
| **D**ependency Inversion | Core depends on ports; adapters implement them; entrypoints wire choices. |

## "Self as a person row"

The user is represented as an ordinary `persons` row with `is_self = true`, rather than as a special-cased
concept elsewhere in the schema or API. Consequences:

- Relationships are uniform, directed edges between two person ids — the user's own relationships (e.g.
  "reports to", "sibling of") are simply edges where `subject_id` is the self person's id. No parallel
  "user relationships" table or API is needed.
- Every tool, query, and CLI command that operates on a person works identically whether or not that person
  is the user.
- It keeps the door open for a future multi-user mode: a second self-flagged person, scoped by owner, would
  not require a separate relationship model. Ownership and the per-owner uniqueness rule still require a
  migration; see [the sync design](design/sync.md#7-multi-user-considerations).

## Accountability audit and replayable changelog

M6 implements ADR [0004](decisions/0004-changelog-vs-audit-log.md): every application mutation executes inside
an explicit `UnitOfWork` and commits primary rows, the accountability audit, persisted HLC advancement, and one
or more full replay changelog entries together. A failure at any point rolls the complete logical operation back.
Read paths do not open a UoW.

The two histories remain intentionally different:

- `audit_log` is user-facing accountability. Payloads may summarize private values; communication philosophy
  continues to record lengths only.
- `changelog` is local replay state. It stores full after-images, installation `device_id`, HLC components,
  transaction grouping, operation kind, changed fields, actor provenance, and payload schema version.

Merge writes row-level child effects and a semantic parent manifest under one `transaction_id`. Forget is the
explicit append-only exception: it hard-deletes primary rows, redacts covered audit and changelog payloads, and
retains an ID-only forget tombstone indefinitely in M6. `people-context sync-log` is the only new inspection
surface; no MCP tool, peer, exchange protocol, or replay engine is introduced.

## Single-user now, multi-user-safe choices

The product is single-user through M6. Several existing choices reduce the cost of future multi-user work
without solving it:

- **IDs are ULIDs**, not auto-increment integers. Their large random component makes collisions across devices
  or users extremely unlikely. Their timestamp prefix is useful for diagnostics, but must not be treated as a
  causal order or global replication cursor when clocks can differ.
- **Self is a person row.** The relationship model remains uniform when `is_self` becomes unique per owner.
- **Assertive records carry provenance and sensitivity.** These columns provide useful attribution and
  disclosure vocabulary, although provenance strings are not authenticated actors.
- **Hexagonal boundaries isolate transports and persistence.** Authenticated transport, sync storage, and
  policy adapters can be added without moving protocol concerns into the domain.

Future multi-user support still needs owner and actor identities, ownership/sharing grants, per-owner `is_self`,
and an inter-user sensitivity policy. The audit log is not the changelog. Full analysis is in
[the sync design](design/sync.md#7-multi-user-considerations).
