# M12 — Trust, stability, and v1.0

Status: Planned. See [docs/roadmap.md](../roadmap.md#m12--trust-stability-and-v10).

## Motivation

`pyproject.toml` still classifies the project as Alpha, although the implementation already follows an additive
response-contract discipline and forward-only migrations. M12 turns that practice into an explicit compatibility
promise, synchronizes every server-distribution surface for 1.0, adds an opt-in encrypted SQLite connection path,
and publishes a factual local-first threat-model comparison.

## Scope

In scope:

- a written MCP, stable-JSON, CLI, and DB compatibility promise;
- a synchronized `1.0.0` primary server release metadata update;
- opt-in SQLCipher at-rest encryption;
- a sourced threat-model comparison with cloud-hosted memory tools;
- README demo polish built on M9's packaged demo.

Non-goals:

- redesigning existing tools or response fields;
- making encryption the default;
- key rotation, keychain integration, or multi-key support;
- implementing deferred incremental sync or multi-user behavior.

## Design

### Compatibility promise

Add `docs/compatibility.md`, linked from the README and `docs/mcp-interface.md`, stating:

- **MCP responses:** within a major version, existing fields are not removed or repurposed; new fields are
  additive; tool names and required parameters remain stable; optional parameters may be added with compatible
  defaults.
- **Database:** migrations are forward-only and additive within a major version; no migration drops or narrows a
  column read by shipped application code.
- **CLI:** existing commands and flags keep working; new flags are additive and preserve previous defaults.
- **Machine-readable outputs:** a command explicitly documented as a stable JSON interface follows the same
  additive-field rule and carries a documented schema/version where appropriate.
- **Human formats:** tables and Markdown remain outside the frozen contract unless separately declared. The vault
  Markdown layout is deterministic but explicitly not frozen in 1.0.

Do not promise a deprecation window the project has not historically practiced.

### Version and release checklist

Bump the root project and classifier to `1.0.0`/Production-Stable. In the same commit synchronize:

1. `pyproject.toml` project version;
2. top-level `server.json.version`;
3. the `people-context` PyPI package entry version in `server.json`;
4. MCPB semantic `mcpb/manifest.json.version`;
5. the exact `people-context` dependency pin in `mcpb/pyproject.toml`.

MCPB `manifest_version` remains an independent schema-version field and is validated against the supported MCPB
schema, never set to the application version.

Because CI runs `uv sync --locked --all-extras` and `uv lock --check`, the PR regenerates and commits root
`uv.lock`; its editable `people-context` package metadata must reflect `1.0.0`. A parser-based test locates the
Registry package by identifier rather than array position and asserts the semantic release values match.

Version domains that distribute or wrap the server remain explicit rather than accidentally synchronized:

- the primary `people-context` distribution exposes the package-aligned server command, the
  `people-context-mcp` server alias, and the `pctx` human CLI;
- `.claude-plugin`, `.codex-plugin`, OpenClaw, and future Obsidian plugin manifests are integration-package
  versions. They are bumped according to their own release/change policy, not mechanically set to the server
  version. If the 1.0 release intentionally publishes one of those artifacts, its own manifest/marketplace
  versions must be internally synchronized and tested.

Follow the existing release procedure and update its checklist, but do not create the tag or live release in this
PR.

### Opt-in SQLCipher

Add an optional dependency extra:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
semantic = ["model2vec>=0.8.2,<0.9", "sqlite-vec>=0.1.9,<0.2"]
encrypted = ["sqlcipher3-binary>=<verified-lower>,<next-breaking>"]
```

Use `sqlcipher3-binary` unless an implementation-time wheel/platform probe demonstrates a blocker for the
project's supported Python/OS matrix; record the exact supported platforms and pinned range. Do not silently ship
an extra that cannot install on a claimed supported platform.

Add `adapters/sqlite/db.py::open_encrypted_db(path, key)` alongside, not as a parameter to, `open_db(path)`. It
sets the key before reading schema metadata or running migrations, then applies the same foreign-key, WAL,
busy-timeout, and migration setup. Existing repositories continue to receive an opaque compatible connection.

`people-context-mcp --encrypted` and the global CLI form `pctx --encrypted ...` require
`PEOPLE_CONTEXT_DB_KEY`. Without the flag, plaintext behavior is unchanged. With the flag and no non-empty key,
startup refuses and never falls back to plaintext.

Changing optional dependencies requires regenerating and committing `uv.lock`. Required validation:

```text
uv lock --check
uv sync --locked --all-extras
uv run --locked ruff check .
uv run --locked pytest -q
```

CI installs the encrypted extra on every platform declared supported for 1.0; tests skip only platforms explicitly
excluded by the documented support matrix.

### Threat-model comparison

Append a dated, sourced subsection under `docs/privacy-and-safety.md#threat-model-notes`. Compare local-first and
cloud-hosted memory tools only on verifiable axes:

- where data is stored at rest;
- what a vendor breach or legal demand can expose;
- whether the product functions fully offline;
- what deletion means compared with this project's hard `forget` behavior.

Use an “as of YYYY-MM-DD” note and primary vendor documentation. Keep the language factual rather than promotional.

### README polish

Add a short Demo section between “Why” and “Quick start”, showing the packaged `pctx demo` flow and its
dedicated database. Link/path check every referenced asset and command.

## Migration needs

No new schema migration. SQLCipher changes the connection-open path, not the logical schema.

## CLI / MCP surface changes

- `people-context-mcp --encrypted`;
- global `pctx --encrypted ...`;
- no MCP tool or response-shape changes.

## Security and privacy

- The key comes only from `PEOPLE_CONTEXT_DB_KEY`, never a flag value, config file, log, exception payload, audit
  payload, or changelog payload.
- Empty/whitespace-only keys are rejected.
- Wrong-key errors are generic and never echo key material or sensitive page contents.
- Verify that the chosen binding protects WAL/SHM data as configured; do not infer protection only because the
  main database cannot be opened by plain SQLite.
- Plain SQLite remains the default and documentation must not imply otherwise.
- A new encrypted database and an existing encrypted database both use the canonical migration path after keying.

## Testing strategy

### Compatibility and release metadata

- link checks for the compatibility document and README additions;
- parser-based synchronization test over `pyproject.toml`, `server.json`, `mcpb/manifest.json`, and
  `mcpb/pyproject.toml`;
- root package version in `uv.lock` matches `pyproject.toml`; `uv lock --check` passes;
- MCPB `manifest_version` validated separately;
- integration-package version domains documented and internally checked only when their artifacts are published.

### Encryption

- missing, empty, and whitespace-only key refusal;
- create/read/reopen encrypted database with the correct key;
- wrong-key refusal;
- plain `sqlite3.connect()` cannot read schema/data;
- WAL-mode writes followed by inspection proving companion files reveal no plaintext sentinel;
- migrations run after keying;
- server and CLI refusal without environment key;
- key sentinels never appear in stdout, stderr, logs, exceptions, audit rows, or changelog rows;
- all existing `open_db` tests pass unmodified;
- locked all-extras installation and tests run in CI.

## Open questions

1. If `sqlcipher3-binary` lacks maintained wheels for a currently supported platform, should 1.0 document the
   encrypted extra as platform-limited or defer encryption until one binding covers the supported matrix?
2. Should a future major version freeze the vault Markdown layout, or should integrations continue to consume
   stable JSON only?
3. When should the dated cloud-tool comparison be reviewed for staleness?
4. Should import-boundary enforcement become automated with import-linter or Ruff in a later hardening PR?
