"""Contract tests for the bundled root usage skill (M10.1).

The Claude Code marketplace validator checks manifests but not skill body content,
so these tests pin the skill's location, frontmatter, and the behavioural invariants
the M10 agent-utilization spec makes binding: resolution-first identity handling, the
strict staged-capture vocabulary, review-before-commit, and disclosure-gate framing.
