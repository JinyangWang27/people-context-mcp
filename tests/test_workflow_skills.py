"""Contract tests for the user-invocable workflow skills (M10.2).

The Claude Code marketplace validator checks skill structure and frontmatter but
not body content, so these tests pin the location, frontmatter, and behavioural
invariants the M10 agent-utilization spec makes binding for the three workflows:

- ``/people-context:who`` resolves identity first and reads context only on a single
  unambiguous match;
- ``/people-context:remember`` distinguishes an explicit person assertion
  (``remember_person``) from extracted knowledge (``stage_candidates``) and never
  auto-commits;
- ``/people-context:reminders`` resolves an optional person before filtering and
  surfaces ambiguity instead of silently dropping the filter.

None of the workflows call or suggest the elevated ``get_sensitive_person_context``
or ``export_data`` tools.
